## Project Description
For our project we will be making a Pokemon inspired text based RPG. In the Pokemon series of games, the player controls a Pokemon trainer. The gameplay is focused around collecting monsters, training them to be stronger, and battling them against other trainers. It is effectively legal dogfighting marketed towards children.
### Language and Tools
We will be writing this game in [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/), and will be utilizing tools such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), [Valgrind](https://www.valgrind.org/), etc. 
### Input and Output
For input and output we will be using the terminal. The game will output the current situation, along with options on how to proceed. The user will then input what they want to do, and the game will respond accordingly. 
### Features
Features of the game will include core Pokemon features, such as battling monsters, catching monsters, using items, and [whiting out because of Whitney's Miltank](https://rage-quit.fandom.com/wiki/Whitney%27s_Miltank_(Pok%C3%A9mon)).

## Class Diagram
Our class diagrams can be viewed [here.](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/bead12b5-0e52-4913-a2b0-adf8b4624c81/edit?viewport_loc=13%2C-36%2C2219%2C989%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_2795bc8a-8a70-4143-a02d-184a171e0b08)
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in with the TA (during lab hours or office hours). Your entire team must be present. 
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also update this README file by adding the following:
 >   * What design patterns did you use? For each design pattern you must explain in 4-5 sentences:
 >     * Why did you pick this pattern? And what feature did you implement with it?
 >     * How did the design pattern help you write better code?
 >   * An updated class diagram that reflects the design patterns you used. You may combine multiple design patterns into one diagram if you'd like, but it needs to be clear which portion of the diagram represents which design pattern (either in the diagram or in the description).
 >   * Make sure your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
> 
> During the meeting with your TA you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
